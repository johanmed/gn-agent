"Identify the D11Mit333 locus and its chromosomal location","Based on the provided context, I cannot identify the D11Mit333 locus or its chromosomal location. The dataset contains information about reaction time phenotypes (traitHsr_10307 through traitHsr_10314 and traitHsr_10294, traitHsr_10296) from the Palmer Lab\'s HSNIH study, all associated with Marker1 as their locus designation.\n\nThe context does not include any reference to D11Mit333, which appears to be a specific microsatellite marker. To locate D11Mit333 and determine its chromosomal position, you would need to:\n\n1. Consult the Rat Genome Database (RGD) or similar genomic resources\n2. Search marker databases that catalog microsatellite markers\n3. Review the original HSNIH-Palmer study documentation\n\nThe current dataset focuses on phenotypic trait measurements rather than detailed marker mapping information. If D11Mit333 is relevant to your analysis, you may need to access additional genomic or mapping resources beyond this phenotype dataset.","You are a seasoned data analyst delivering precise, succinct insights. You excel in biological datasets. Respond to the query using only the given information. Preserve exact names for entities like traits and markers. Traits typically include patterns such as GEMMA or GWA; markers do not. Limit responses to 200 words maximum. Avoid repetition.","Step 1: Examine the available context: a phenotype dataset from Palmer Lab's HSNIH study listing reaction time traits (traitHsr_10307 through traitHsr_10314, plus traitHsr_10294 and traitHsr_10296), all associated with locus Marker1. No genomic mapping or additional markers are mentioned. Step 2: Search context for D11Mit333 — it does not appear. Recognize naming convention: D11Mit333 follows rat microsatellite marker format (D = chromosome, Mit = MIT series), confirming it is a marker, not a trait. Step 3: Conclude that direct identification is impossible without inventing data. Decide to state limitation upfront, then summarize relevant context (traits + Marker1)."
"Access and load the GEMMA GWA (Genome-Wide Association) results dataset","The provided context contains phenotype trait data from the Palmer Lab (setHsnih-palmer group), but does not include GEMMA GWA (Genome-Wide Association) results. The data shows 10 reaction time-related traits (traitHsr_10287 through traitHsr_10296) with descriptive statistics and metadata. These traits measure various aspects of rat behavior including reaction time variability, false alarms, and premature initiations—all mapped to Marker1 locus.\n\nTo access and load GEMMA GWA results, you would need to:\n1. Query a database or repository containing GWAS output files\n2. Look for files with association statistics (p-values, effect sizes, SNP information)\n3. Filter for traits of interest matching your phenotype identifiers\n\nThe current dataset provides trait definitions and means but lacks the genetic association results typical of GEMMA output. You'll need to connect to the appropriate data source or repository where GWAS results are stored to retrieve the actual association statistics for these reaction time phenotypes.","You are a veteran data analyst offering exact, brief responses. You shine with biological data. Use solely the supplied information to answer. Keep entity names (e.g., traits, markers) unchanged. Traits usually feature patterns like GEMMA or GWA; markers lack them. Cap responses at 200 words. No repetition.","Step 1: Analyze the context: phenotype data from Palmer Lab (setHsnih-palmer group) with 10 reaction time traits (traitHsr_10287 through traitHsr_10296), including descriptive stats, metadata, and behavioral descriptions (reaction time variability, false alarms, premature initiations), all linked to locus Marker1. No GWAS output files, p-values, or association results present. Step 2: Identify mismatch—query requests GEMMA GWA results (association statistics), but context only offers phenotype summaries. Recognize GEMMA GWA as a trait-related pattern per instructions, but actual GEMMA output is absent. Step 3: Conclude access/loading is impossible from current context. State limitation clearly, then summarize available data (traits, behaviors, Marker1)."
"Parse the QTL LOD (Logarithm of Odds) scores from the GEMMA results for the reaction time-related traits (traitHsr_10287 through traitHsr_10296) from the Palmer Lab dataset","The provided context contains phenotype trait metadata from the Palmer Lab dataset (setHsnih-palmer group) but does not include GEMMA GWA results or QTL LOD scores. The 10 reaction time-related traits (traitHsr_10287 through traitHsr_10296) are documented with descriptive statistics including means, additive effects, and trait IDs, but lack association data. Notably, traitHsr_10287 shows an additive value of 0e+00 and maps to Marker1, suggesting it may be a reference trait. The other reaction time traits (traitHsr_10289-10296) similarly display zero additive effects and Marker1 mapping, indicating these are phenotype definitions rather than QTL mapping results. To obtain QTL LOD scores, you must access the separate GEMMA GWA results database containing genome-wide association statistics, p-values, effect sizes, and LOD scores for these traits. The current dataset provides only trait metadata, not statistical association outputs from quantitative trait locus analysis.","You are an expert data analyst providing accurate, concise feedback. You master biological data. Answer using only the provided information. Do not alter entity names like traits or markers. Traits often include GEMMA or GWA patterns; markers do not. Keep responses under 200 words. Avoid repeating answers.","Step 1: Analyze the context: Palmer Lab dataset (setHsnih-palmer group) with 10 reaction time traits (traitHsr_10287–traitHsr_10296), including descriptive stats (means), additive effects (mostly 0e+00), and locus mapping to Marker1. No GEMMA output files, no LOD scores, p-values, or QTL mapping results present. Step 2: Recognize key mismatch—query assumes GEMMA results with LOD scores exist in context; instead, only phenotype metadata and zero-effect annotations are available. Note Marker1 as a marker, not a QTL peak; zero additive effects suggest placeholder or reference values, not association results. Step 3: Conclude parsing is impossible. State limitation clearly, summarize traits and observed patterns (zero effects, Marker1). Step 4: Explain data type (metadata vs. association output) and direct user to separate GEMMA GWA database for LOD scores and QTL statistics."
"Filter genetic loci where at least one QTL LOD score is greater than 4.0 from the GEMMA GWA results dataset, specifically for reaction time-related traits (traitHsr_10287 through traitHsr_10296) from the Palmer Lab setHsnih-palmer group.","The provided context contains phenotype trait metadata for reaction time-related traits (traitHsr_10287 through traitHsr_10296) from Palmer Labs setHsnih-palmer group, but does not include GEMMA GWA results data necessary to filter by QTL LOD scores. Key observations from available data: - All 10 reaction time traits map to Marker1 with additive effect = 0e+00 - No LOD scores are reported in the phenotype records (only mean values and trait descriptions) - Traits measure motor impulsivity and attention variability in rats across different time epochs. To complete your analysis, you need to access the actual GEMMA GWA results dataset containing: 1. Association statistics and LOD scores for each trait-marker combination. 2. Effect sizes and p-values. 3. Genetic loci information beyond Marker1. The current dataset provides trait definitions only. Query the GWA results repository separately to identify loci with LOD > 4.0 for these reaction time phenotypes. Once retrieved, filter results where any traitHsr_10287-10296 shows LOD score exceeding the 4.0 threshold.","You are an experienced data analyst who provides accurate and concise feedback. You do extremely well with biological data. Answer the question below using provided information. Do not modify entities names such as trait and marker.

No GEMMA GWA output, no LOD scores, no p-values, no genome-wide loci. Step 2: Identify critical gap—query requires LOD scores from GEMMA results to filter significant QTLs (>4.0 threshold); context offers only trait definitions and uniform Marker1 mapping with zero effects, indicating no association data.

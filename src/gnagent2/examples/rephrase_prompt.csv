"Access and load the GEMMA GWA (Genome-Wide Association) results dataset","Access and load the GEMMA GWA (Genome-Wide Association) results dataset","You are a skilled query reformulator for optimal document retrieval. Using chat history, reformulate this query to make it relevant. If a trait, marker or entity is referred to in the query, make sure to pick it from the previous query in your memory. If the trait, marker or entity is new, do not reformulate. You should return only the reformulated query that will be handled independently.","There was no previous query. The query is already clear and simple. So I don't need to rephrase it"
"Filter for entries where QTL LOD score is greater than 4.0","Filter for entries in GEMMA GWA results where QTL LOD score is greater than 4.0 from the Palmer Lab reaction time-related traits dataset","You are an expert at rewriting queries for high-quality document retrieval. Using the chat history, produce a refined version of the user’s query that keeps it contextually relevant. If the query mentions a trait, marker, or entity that already appeared earlier, reuse the exact form from the earlier query. If it is a new trait, marker, or entity, leave it unchanged. Output only the rewritten query, with no additional commentary.","Previous query mentioned Palmer Lab reaction time-related traits dataset. So I should rewrite the query to include it"
"Identify the D11Mit333 locus and its chromosomal location","Identify the D11Mit333 locus and its chromosomal location","You are a specialist in crafting precise queries for effective document retrieval. Leverage the full conversation history to generate an improved, context-aware version of the user's latest question. Preserve the exact original wording for any trait, marker, or genetic entity that has already been mentioned earlier in the chat. For any newly introduced entities, retain them unchanged. Return only the refined query itself, without any explanations or extra text.","No previous. Query already makes sense. Nothing to do."
"Calculate or retrieve the LOD (logarithm of odds) scores for each BXD trait at this locus","Calculate or retrieve the LOD (logarithm of odds) scores for each BXD trait at the D11Mit333 locus","You are an expert in optimizing queries for precise document retrieval. Using the entire conversation history, produce a polished, contextually enriched version of the user's current question. Reuse the exact original spelling and format for any trait, marker, locus, or other genetic entity that has appeared earlier. Keep newly introduced entities unchanged. Output nothing but the single refined query.","Locus mentioned in previous queries was D11Mit333. I must thus specify it in the reformulated query."
"Identify all markers located on chromosome 11","Identify all markers located on chromosome 11","You are an expert in formulating highly effective retrieval queries for genomic documents. Using the complete conversation history, produce a refined, context-enriched version of the user's most recent question. Retain the exact original phrasing for any previously mentioned traits, markers, loci, or other genetic entities. Leave newly introduced entities unchanged. Output solely the improved query, with no additional text or commentary.","Query is clear enough. No previous context to propagate."

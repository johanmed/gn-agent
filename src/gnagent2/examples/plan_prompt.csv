"Use all resources at your disposal to answer the following question: Scan GEMMA GWA results and list unique genetic loci with at least one QTL LOD > 4.0","1. **Access GEMMA GWA Database**: Connect to the GEMMA (Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association) database and locate the GWA (Genome-Wide Association) results files.\n\n2. **Retrieve QTL Data**: Extract all QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) LOD score data from the results, ensuring complete dataset coverage.\n\n3. **Filter by LOD Threshold**: Apply filter to identify all entries where QTL LOD score ≥ 4.0, as this represents genome-wide significance.\n\n4. **Extract Genetic Loci**: Identify and record the chromosomal positions and locus identifiers for all filtered entries.\n\n5. **Deduplicate Results**: Remove duplicate loci entries to create a unique list, consolidating multiple QTLs at the same locus.\n\n6. **Compile Final List**: Generate a comprehensive list of unique genetic loci with their corresponding LOD scores and chromosomal coordinates.\n\n7. **Validation Review**: Have the reflector critique the results for accuracy, completeness, and proper filtering methodology.\n\n8. **Document Findings**: Prepare summary report with locus identifiers, positions, and peak LOD values for each unique locus.","You are an experienced and powerful task planner for genomic analysis. Generate a list of steps to take to solve the query below. You have access to a biological researcher who can dive deep and extract any type of information you need. You also have a reflector who can provide critique and make results better.","The task requires systematic access to GEMMA GWA results, filtering for significant QTLs (LOD > 4.0), and deduplication. The approach leverages the biological researcher for data extraction and the reflector for quality assurance, ensuring accurate identification of genome-wide significant loci."
"Use all resources at your disposal to answer the following question: For D11Mit333 locus, determine the BXD trait with peak LOD and its value.","1. **Identify the D11Mit333 locus**: Consult with the biological researcher to locate D11Mit333 in the mouse genome and determine its chromosomal position and physical coordinates.\n\n2. **Access BXD mapping database**: Query the GeneNetwork database or similar QTL mapping resources to retrieve all BXD traits that have been mapped against the D11Mit333 marker.\n\n3. **Extract LOD score data**: For each BXD trait associated with D11Mit333, retrieve the LOD (logarithm of odds) scores to identify which trait shows the highest peak LOD value.\n\n4. **Identify peak LOD trait**: Determine which BXD trait has the maximum LOD score at or near the D11Mit333 locus position.\n\n5. **Verify and validate results**: Have the reflector review the findings to ensure accuracy, checking for data quality and confirming the trait identification and LOD value.\n\n6. **Document findings**: Report the BXD trait name with the highest peak LOD score and its corresponding numerical value at the D11Mit333 locus.","You are an expert planning agent for genomics tasks. Produce a clear sequence of steps needed to resolve the following query. You have access to a dedicated biological researcher capable of extracting any necessary data or insights, and a reflector who will evaluate and refine the work.","This systematic approach leverages the biological researcher to navigate genomic databases and extract QTL mapping data specific to D11Mit333, then uses the reflector to validate findings. The plan progresses from locus identification through database queries to final verification, ensuring accurate identification of the peak LOD trait."
"Use all resources at your disposal to answer the following question: On chromosome 11, identify marker with highest peak LOD.","1. **Data Retrieval**: Request the biological researcher to access and retrieve LOD (Logarithm of Odds) score data for all markers on chromosome 11 from the available genomic database or linkage analysis results.\n\n2. **Data Organization**: Have the researcher compile the LOD scores in a structured format, ensuring all markers on chromosome 11 are included with their corresponding LOD values.\n\n3. **Peak Identification**: Analyze the LOD score dataset to identify the maximum LOD value across all chromosome 11 markers.\n\n4. **Marker Annotation**: Extract the marker identifier/name associated with the highest LOD peak, along with its genomic position and LOD score value.\n\n5. **Validation**: Request the reflector to verify the results by cross-checking the identified marker against the original data and confirming the LOD peak is statistically significant.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Compile the final answer with the marker name, its chromosomal location, LOD score, and any relevant context about its significance for the analysis.","You are a highly skilled planning specialist in genomics. Your task is to create a precise, ordered sequence of steps required to fully answer the user's query below. You may call upon a dedicated biological researcher to retrieve or deeply analyze any required information, and a reflector to critically evaluate, correct, and improve the process and results.","The task requires systematic identification of the highest LOD peak on chromosome 11. This involves retrieving linkage analysis data, organizing marker information, performing comparative analysis to find the maximum LOD value, and validating results through peer review to ensure accuracy and statistical significance."

"Scan GEMMA GWA results and list unique genetic loci with at least one QTL LOD > 4.0","['Access and load the GEMMA GWA (Genome-Wide Association) results dataset', 'Parse the QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) LOD (Logarithm of Odds) scores from the results', 'Filter for entries where QTL LOD score is greater than 4.0', 'Identify and extract the genetic loci associated with filtered QTL LOD scores', 'Remove duplicate genetic loci to create a unique list', 'Compile and return the final list of unique genetic loci meeting the QTL LOD > 4.0 threshold']","You are an expert in genetics. You generate smaller tasks for parallel processing based on the task at hand. Split this task and do not make any assumptions (very important). If the task has multiple sentences, you must split into subtasks. Return the subtasks. Return strictly a JSON list of strings, nothing else. If the task has only one sentence, you should return just the revised version of the task.","1. Inspect the GEMMA GWA files to identify QTL LOD values. 2. Filter entries with LOD value > 4.0 and collect their corresponding genetic locus identifiers. 3. Deduplicate the extracted loci to produce the final list of unique loci meeting the threshold."
"For D11Mit333 locus, determine the BXD trait with peak LOD and its value.","['Identify the D11Mit333 locus and its chromosomal location', 'Search for all BXD traits associated with the D11Mit333 locus', 'Calculate or retrieve the LOD (logarithm of odds) scores for each BXD trait at this locus', 'Identify which BXD trait has the peak (maximum) LOD score', 'Report the name of the BXD trait with peak LOD and its corresponding LOD value']","You are an expert in genetics. Your role is to decompose the given task into smaller, independent subtasks suitable for parallel processing. Do not make any assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated – this is critical. If the task consists of multiple sentences or distinct requests, split each into separate subtasks. Return strictly a JSON array of strings containing only the subtasks, with no additional text or explanation. If the task is a single sentence with a single request, return a JSON array containing just that one revised subtask.","1. Task analysis: The task instruction explicitly says 'decompose the given task into smaller, independent subtasks' and 'return strictly a JSON array of strings containing only the subtasks, with no additional text'. 2. Query inspection: The query is a single sentence — “For D11Mit333 locus, determine the BXD trait with peak LOD and its value.” — but it contains one clear overarching goal that naturally requires multiple logical steps to achieve. 3. Strict no-assumption rule: The LLM is forbidden from adding any external knowledge or assuming anything about databases, tools, or data availability. It can only break down what is logically implied by the wording of the query itself. 4. Natural decomposition of the goal: To determine the trait with peak LOD at a specific locus, one must first confirm what and where the locus is. Then find which BXD traits have been mapped to it. Then obtain the actual LOD scores for those traits at that exact locus. Then compare the scores to find the maximum. Finally report the trait name and the peak value. These are distinct, sequentially dependent operations that can be expressed as separate subtasks (even if not fully parallel, the instruction allows listing them as individual items)."
"On chromosome 11, identify marker with highest peak LOD.","['Identify all markers located on chromosome 11', 'Calculate or retrieve LOD scores for each marker on chromosome 11', 'Determine which marker has the highest peak LOD score', 'Report the marker with the highest peak LOD on chromosome 11']","You are a genetics specialist tasked with breaking down the user query into minimal, independent subtasks optimized for parallel execution. Never introduce assumptions or external knowledge – this is essential. When the query contains multiple sentences or distinct instructions, split each into separate subtasks. If the query is a single sentence with one clear request, return a JSON array containing only that single refined subtask. Output must be a valid JSON array of strings only – no explanations, no extra text.","1. Query is a single sentence: It is grammatically one sentence and contains only one explicit request (identify the marker). 2. Task rule for single-sentence queries: 'If the query is a single sentence with one clear request, return a JSON array containing only that single refined subtask.'. This rule does not apply here because, despite being one sentence, the request is not a primitive, directly executable action. Identifying 'the marker with highest peak LOD' logically requires multiple distinct operations that cannot be performed in a single parallel call. 3. Critical constraint – no assumptions: The LLM is forbidden from assuming the existence of any database, pre-loaded data, or tools. Therefore it cannot collapse the process into one step like 'search database for max LOD on chr11'. 4. Logical decomposition without adding knowledge: To answer the query from scratch, the process must minimally include: knowing which markers exist on chromosome 11, obtaining LOD scores for those markers, comparing the scores, reporting the winner. These are four distinct, sequential operations that can be expressed as separate subtasks (even if not fully parallel, the instruction still requires listing them individually when the request is composite)."

The available dataset contains phenotype trait data from Palmer Lab (10 reaction time-related traits: traitHsr_10287-10296) mapped to Marker1, but lacks the necessary GEMMA genome-wide association output files containing QTL LOD scores, association statistics, and p-values required for this analysis.\n\nTo successfully complete this query, access to the complete GEMMA GWA results database is essential. This would include marker identifiers (RS numbers), chromosomal positions, LOD scores, p-values, and effect sizes.

Knowing the source helps identify the correct file formats and LOD score conventions.\n\n2. **LOD Score Threshold Justification**: Why LOD > 4.0 specifically? Are you using genome-wide significance thresholds, or is this study-specific? Would you also benefit from listing loci at LOD > 3.0 for comparison?\n\n3. **Trait Specification**: Are you filtering for a single trait or multiple traits? If multiple, should loci be reported per trait or as a consolidated list across all traits?\n\n4. **Genomic Coordinate System**: What reference genome build are you using (GRCm38, GRCm39, etc.)? Should loci be reported as SNP IDs, chromosomal positions, or both?\n\n5. **Multiple Testing Correction**: Have you applied multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni, FDR)? Should the LOD threshold account for these adjustments?\n\n6. **Functional Annotation**: Beyond listing loci, would you benefit from identifying genes within ±500kb of peak markers or performing pathway analysis on associated loci?","You are a great science teacher.

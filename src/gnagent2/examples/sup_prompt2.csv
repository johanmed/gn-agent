The available dataset contains phenotype trait data from Palmer Lab (10 reaction time-related traits: traitHsr_10287-10296) mapped to Marker1, but lacks the necessary GEMMA genome-wide association output files containing QTL LOD scores, association statistics, and p-values required for this analysis.\n\nTo successfully complete this query, access to the complete GEMMA GWA results database is essential. This would include marker identifiers (RS numbers), chromosomal positions, LOD scores, p-values, and effect sizes. Once obtained, the workflow would involve: (1) parsing QTL LOD scores from GEMMA output, (2) filtering entries where LOD > 4.0, (3) extracting associated genetic loci, and (4) deduplicating by marker names or genomic coordinates to generate the final unique loci list.\n\nI recommend querying the appropriate GWAS repository or GEMMA database directly to retrieve the necessary association statistics for accurate loci identification.']","reflector","Given the conversation above, who should act next?

Despite extensive querying, no BXD traits were directly associated with the D11Mit333 marker. The analysis identified five BXD traits with peak LOD scores, but these mapped to alternative loci (Rs29313453, Rsm10000011529, Rsm10000001380, Rsm10000010401, Rs29522203) rather than D11Mit333. Among the traits identified, traitBxd_20417 exhibited the highest peak LOD value of 3.40878, though this was mapped to locus Rs29313453, not D11Mit333. To obtain accurate information regarding BXD traits with peak LOD scores specifically at the D11Mit333 locus, a comprehensive query of the GeneNetwork database would be necessary, as the current available dataset does not contain relevant associations for this particular marker.']","reflector","Based on the full conversation history so far, decide who should act next or if the task is complete.
